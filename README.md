# Queu-E

# Introduction:

Queu-E is an initiative to make regular life happen while following Covid-19 safety precautions. It is the same thing of tokens but all what is replaced is a paper with your mobile while escaping the fuss of standing in a queue! So whether the place is bank, temple, health clinic or education centers , get your token number within seconds without any worries. No need to count each second and save those anxiety attacks when a person around you sneezes.

Organizations can register with few simple steps and anyone can get the token for the registered organizations on the ‘Queu-E’ app just by logging in via e-mail or mobile number.
